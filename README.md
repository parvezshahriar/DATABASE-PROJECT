# `game_sales` table

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit.

But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1994. Using Python and data analysis techniques, we aim to:

- Understand trends in user vs. critic scores.
- Compare global vs. regional sales.
- Identify potential best-selling genres and platforms.
